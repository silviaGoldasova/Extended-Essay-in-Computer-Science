## Topic
Extended-Essay-in-Computer-Science: Comparing the efficiency of different algorithms for solving the knapsack problem

## About
The research paper follows four algorithms: brute force, dynamic programming, greedy approximation and branch and bound appropriate algorithm, that were implemented and run on the specified datasets. Based on the analysis of the gathered data, algorithms were evaluated in the terms of their efficiency when solving the Knapsack problem. 

## Research question
To what extent are the brute force, dynamic programming, greedy approximation and branch and bound appropriate approaches for solving the 0/1 Knapsack problem in terms of runtime and finding the optimal solution?
